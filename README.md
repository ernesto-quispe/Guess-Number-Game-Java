# Overview

I set out to create an interactive number guessing game to explore core language features such as classes, methods, control flow, and file handling. This project serves as a practical exercise to apply fundamental programming concepts and strengthen my understanding of Java syntax and structure.

The software I developed is a number guessing game where the program randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess it within a limited number of tries. It tracks game statistics such as total games played, games won, games lost, and average number of attempts in winning games, which can be saved to a text file for record-keeping.

My purpose for writing this software was to gain hands-on experience with Java’s object-oriented programming capabilities, learn how to manage input/output operations, and implement game logic in a structured way.
